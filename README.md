# Basic Chess CLI game

## A Java application that allows two Human users to play chess using Terminal CLI. 

Built using native java and vanilla java with only inbuilt libraries, which can be further extended to have a chess engine where a player can play against a CPU player(It has not been implemented yet).

While, the main function of playing chess is present and the application is open to future improvements. Potential improvements include a GUI, finishing the saving/loading system, interfacing with the cloud to play against someone remotely using Hadoop or something similar, etc.


### How to Run
```
